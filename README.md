The code for the circuit
There are comments on the code explaining the important functions and parts, as well as clear coding.
The project is a light sequential circuit where the switch controls 2 LEDs and they turn on one after the other, then both simultaneously.
The second part of the circuit has a potentiometer controlling an LED.
